# Traveless â€“ Smart Ship Routing UI (Drifters | SIH 2024)

**Traveless** is a front-end UI prototype designed as part of the **Drifters** team submission for **Smart India Hackathon 2024** (PS ID: SIH1658). The project focuses on optimizing ship navigation routes using AI-powered algorithms while providing an intuitive interface for voyage logging, route selection, and real-time monitoring.

ðŸŒŠ **Problem Statement:**  
Develop a versatile and fast algorithm for optimal ship routing, tailored for the Indian Ocean region.

ðŸš¢ **Project Focus:**  
While the core algorithm (A*, PSO, ACO) and backend logic were prototyped separately, this GitHub repo showcases the **frontend interface** for:

- **Logging ship details**
- **Displaying optimized route descriptions**
- **Demonstrating page navigation flow for user inputs**

---

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Implemented in This Repo

This repository specifically demonstrates:

- **Static UI pages built using HTML/CSS/JS**
- **Ship detail logging interface**
- **Route description page for optimized paths**
- **Basic flow mimicking real-time route selection**
